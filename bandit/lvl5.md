 - The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties: human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, not executable
```bash
cd inhere
cd maybehere07
ls -la -h
cat .file2
```
-  Accidentally messed up the size formatting (1000 vs 1k) so I kinda had to guess
