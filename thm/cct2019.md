> Legacy challenges from the US Navy Cyber Competition Team 2019 Assessment sponsored by US TENTH Fleet

I think this is the longest a CTF has ever taken me
#### Steps

**Challenge 1**
- The first pcap file only has 20 frames
- They are all `URB_BULK` packets, which is a `USB` protocol
- frame number 2 had the visible file name `pcap_chal.pcap` in the hex data
- Seeing this I ran `binwalk` to extract any other files within the pcap
```
└─$ binwalk pcap2_1583863710056.pcapng   

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
471           0x1D7           Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: 2308021, uncompressed size: 2731652, name: pcap_chal.pcap
2309652       0x233E14        End of Zip archive, footer length: 22
```
- Extracting with `binwalk -e` directly didn't work and since the challenge specified maintaining file integrity was really important I decided to try a different method
- Instead I extracted the hex data directly and ran binwalk on that
- For this I used `tshark`
```shell
# -r for infile, -T for text output format, -e specify field, usb.capdata is the leftover capture data
tshark -r pcap2_1583863710056.pcapng -T fields -e usb.capdata > extractedpcap
```
- https://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/u/usb.html -> wireshark docs are helpful for field names
- `extractepcap` is useless to binwalk since it's pure hex data, so I converted it
```shell
# hex to binary
└─$ cat extractedpcap | xxd -r -p >> unhexed

└─$ file unhexed      
unhexed: data

└─$ binwalk unhexed      

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28            0x1C            Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: 2308021, uncompressed size: 2731652, name: pcap_chal.pcap
2308189       0x23385D        End of Zip archive, footer length: 22
```
- Yayyyyyy :>
- Now we can extract with `binwalk -e` with no issues
- CDed into the extracted directory
```shell
└─$ ls
1C.zip  pcap_chal.pcap
```
- `pcap_chal.pcap` is a much larger pcap file filled a variety of requests `ICMP, TCP, TLS, DNS`, etc
- `TCP` and `DNS` requests are usually the easiest to decipher so I started with those
- Following the `TCP` steam first, I found a couple intersting convos

```
- I followed `DNS` aka `UDP` stream next which was mostly just the same google mozzila cloudflare github medium font api oscp (and cyber.meme.tips) things I had seen before
- First I started with the GET request (found in and #2) for the site `fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=e7e47ecfd72c324519c9a72239cd2b399aaafc4b.9686`
- Which was basically steg analysis on this REALLY weird looking picture
- None of the site steg checks found anything useful so I downloaded the image
```

- Ok this might just be nothing
- Moving on to the IRC convo we have the username `binaryphalanx`, the password `RedRoverRedRover$$`, and the unique id `108AAAAAC`
- At this point I was kinda stuck. I have some info but nothing to do with it
- I decided maybeee I should check the `ICMP` packets I had been ignoring for the past hour (there's no easy follow stream option, sue me idc)
- I basically just speed scrolled through `ICMP` packets until I got a bright yellow message transfer param highlighted and continued doing this to decipher the conversation
```
# ROUGH recreation
- hi wyd
= hi nm
- u didn't send the thing
= not over this tf
- ok then over what
= lets use cryptcat instead
- another thing to install?
= no one can see this
- id still rather use encryption
= we need to pick a key to use
- ik just the one 
- Angela Bennett uses it to log into the Bethesda Naval Hospital
= that old thing?
- lemme look it up rq
- found it, use the metasploit port to recieve
= listener is up, send it
- ok, it's sent
= 7181f4d45de00ae35b6cf8201c8d852b
- hash is good
```
- Ok so we have a password `BER5348833` and a tool `cryptcat` 
- The default listening port for most is `4444` so I checked traffic under that port `tcp.port == 4444`
- Used tshark for extraction:
```shell
└─$ tshark -r pcap_chal.pcap -Y 'tcp.dstport == 4444' -Tfields -e data.data > stream
└─$ cat stream | xxd -r -p >> encfile
```
- Transferred and decrypted the file
```shell
└─$ cryptcat -vv -k BER5348833 -lp 7777 > dec

└─$ nc -vv -w 1 localhost 7777 < encfile

└─$ file dec
dec: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=10e9d33fce367a29cfe8d74866c3cb474ec61172, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
```
- Modding perms and running the file itself threw an error
- Running `strings` on the file I found this
```
PRIVMSG H

CAP LS 302

NICK cct
JOIN #flag
```
- I also found the string `gethostbyname` which is definitely referring to `DNS`
- Based on the IRC convo from the pcap file earlier I assumed that the DNS resolution was through localhost
- So I modified my `/etc/hosts` file with the `irc.cct` domain
```sh
└─$ sudo sh -c "echo '127.0.0.1 irc.cct' >> /etc/hosts"
```
- The file makes requests through the default IRC port `6667` so I set up a listener with `nc -lvnp 6667` and ran the file
```sh
└─$ ./dec
Found the server at 127.0.0.1
Connected to my server!


└─$ nc -lvnp 6667

```
- Done! (except for 3 more tasks </3)

**Challenge 2**
- After downloading the file, I first checked for any obvious anomalies 
```
└─$ file re3_1583875067748.exe 
re3_1583875067748.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows, 3 sections

└─$ binwalk re3_1583875067748.exe 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             Microsoft executable, portable (PE)

10587         0x295B          XML document, version: "1.0"
```
- Finding nothing out of the ordinary here, I started reverse engineering the executable 
- Running it on windows, it showed a window with four sliders that you could move to change the numbers displayed. After you move the sliders you could check your answer to see if you have gotten it right
- Based on the behavior of the program, I assumed the sliders either had to match certain numbers or add up to a certain number to get the flag
- Any wrong answers are met with `None shall pass! Again? Give up?`
- Running `strings` shows that the file is a `.NET` executable (Dotfuscator mentioned), so I downloaded `dotPeek` to decompile it
- Right click exported the project to my IDE so I could look at all the C# code
- Focusing mainly on the `a.cs` file I found this section
```cs
	int num1 = 711;
	int num2 = 711000000;
    if (A_0_1 + A_1_1 + A_2 + A_4 == num1 && A_0_1 * A_1_1 * A_2 * A_4 == num2 && A_0_1 > A_1_1 && A_1_1 > A_2 && A_2 > A_4)
    {
      int num3 = (int) MessageBox.Show(this.goodBoy(A_0_1, A_1_1, A_2, A_4, (byte[]) this.byteA.Clone()));
    }
    else
    {
      int num4 = (int) MessageBox.Show(this.badBoy(A_0_1, A_1_1, A_2, A_4, (byte[]) this.byteA.Clone()));
    }
```
- This basically says that the numbers on the sliders must add up to equal `711`, multiply to equal `711000000`, and each successive value is smaller than the last 
- So I wrote some python code to find the four values 
```python
def nums():
    num1 = 711
    num2 = 711000000
    for val1 in range(1, 711):
        for val2 in range(1, val1):
            for val3 in range(1, val2):
                for val4 in range(1, val3):
                    if (val1 + val2 + val3 + val4 == num1 and
                            val1 * val2 * val3 * val4 == num2):
                        print(val1, val2, val3, val4)
    return None

solution = nums()
print(solution)
```
- Input the values for the sliders and got the flag!

**Challenge 3**
- The file for this challenge is a `jpeg`
- Started out with steg checks, string, binwalk, etc
```

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01
30            0x1E            TIFF image data, big-endian, offset of first image directory: 8

29529         0x7359          End of Zip archive, footer length: 22
```
- So its  `JFIF` adobe image with `exif` data, contains a `fakeflag.txt` file 
- Running exiftool I found this section
```
Description                     : .--- ..- ... - .- .-- .- .-. -- ..- .--. .-. .. --. .... - ..--..
```
- Which decodes to `JUSTAWARM*******?` 
- I extracted the zip archive with `binwalk -e` which revealed an empty fakeflag file and a password protected zip archive which also contained a fakeflag file
- To find the password `0ni0n_0f_**********` I ran the image through https://georgeom.net/StegOnline/image with the LSB Half filter
- This password didn't work, so I used the hint which was about lowercase passwords and used the first string from the morse code as the password
- This password worked and I got the contents of the real `fakeflag.txt` file, which contained another password `Z1******`
- Assuming there was another zip file that binwalk didn't catch, I used steghide to keep searching
- The third password worked for this one
```
└─$ steghide extract -sf for1_8f90d68390b565c308871a52c6572de8_1583875226079.jpeg 
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "archive.zip".
```
- I extracted `archive.zip` with the second password which contained more txt files and a `flag.zip` archive
```
└─$ cat cipher.txt  
FSXL PXTH EKYT DJXS PYMO JLAY VPRP VO

└─$ cat config.txt 
C G. VI. VII. VIII. AMTU RING AM BY CH DR EL FX GO IV JN KU PS QT WZ
```
- I replaced the cipher text with `JHSL PGLW YSQO DQVL PFAO TPCY KPUD TF` per the challenge description
- the config file contains instructions for the enigma machine (M4 Shark, UKW C thin, first group of 4 are position, second four are ring)
- Output minus spaces is the flag password `ctfforensics**********************`
```
└─$ cat flag.txt    
CCT{Well_that_wasn't***************************}
```
- Done!
**Challenge 4**
- I started by running `binwalk` on the file, which showed it contained two zip archives
```sh
└─$ binwalk crypto1_1583878372378.zip 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION

# unzipped the file
└─$ ls
crypto1_1583878372378.zip  crypto1a.txt  crypto1a.zip
```
- The txt file contained cipher texts that looked like it was alphabet encoded, ROTed, substitution encoded, or something similar
```
└─$ cat crypto1a.txt

```
- I use dcode.fr for most of my decoding, so I tried the cipher identifier on that site
- The highest result was a hill cipher (which didn't work)
- I tried monoalphabetic:
```

|🔤₁|AXJEVUIDCHTNMBRLZPOYGKWQFS|
|🔤₂|ANIHDYUJGCVPMLSRXOZKFEWBTQ|
```
- But this didn't give me the layout answer
- So I tried keyboard swap:
```
aN EASY TECHNIQUE FOR SOLVING cAESAR SUBSTITUTION CIPHERS WILL ONLY GET YOU SO FAR BECAUSE OF PUNCTUATION SYMBOLS>  sTILL< IT SHOULD GET YOU CLOSE ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT THE REST>  bUT CAN YOU FIGURE OUT THE KEY WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE NAME OF THE 'LAYOUT' WHICH CREATED THIS> aCTUALLY< YOU HAD BETTER ENTER IT THRICE JUST TO BE SAFE 9ALL LOWER_CASE IF YOU PLEASE0>
```
- So the key is the name of the layout that created the ciphertext, all lowercase and repeated three times, which is the name of the keyboard layout used to decode the ciphertext
- Using that to unzip the file, we get the first flag `CCT{Actu4***************}`
- Now on to `crypto1b`
```
A word of advice for the next one. Don't straddle the fence or you'll end up riding a rail or five. It'll hurt from the bottom up.

```
- Advice was a lil wild but this one isn't too bad
- Started back with the dcode cipher identifier, which identified transposition cipher, skip cipher, and a few others
- The hint mentions rails and fences, which was referring to the `rail fence cipher`
- I made sure to keep punctuation and spaces while decoding, and I ended up with this barely legible jumble of letters:
```

- Yeah there are obviously some missing letters
- `I've egin a ms npelli fein tht oitle  upa cliottn youb  e.` something about a youtube clip
- `hTkey. e t way ete gooss  pellseecrrififnhrom` and something about the key
- the key is the way the goose spells ???
- I looked up "the way the goose spells" and got a bunch of results with the word "terrific" in it
- One youtube video title was `Goose Spells Teerrrriiffiiccc` and based on the missing letters and other things going on in the semi decoded ciphertext, I guessed that the key was `teerrrriiffiiccc` or some modification of it
- Doing some more reasearch, I found this excerpt 
```
According to the goose, it’s, “T double-E double-R double-R double-I double-F double-I double C, C, C!” (E.B.White, _Charlotte’s Web_).
```
- `teerrrriiffiicccccc`!
- And we get the flag `CCT{th@t_w4s***************}` honestly more OSINT than decoding
- On to `crypto1c`:
```
Last one of the basic batch. But is it compression, encoding, or encryption?

```
- Provided hint: start with `0`, not `1`
- Looks like a mix of binary and ascii
- After staring at it *really* hard for about 10 minutes I was like "what uses a ton of repetition and seems much longer than the final result should be?"
- Run Length Encoding! read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding)
- So back to dcode we go
- I decoded it in binary mode (0 first as the hint says)

- Binary -> ascii and we got the flag 
```
You've made it this far. You've solved all of the crypto challenges from the basic batch, but there are more challenges ahead. How will you fare against those I wonder. At any rate, well done and here is your flag: CCT{I_see_***************************}
```
- Done!
