> Legacy challenges from the US Navy Cyber Competition Team 2019 Assessment sponsored by US TENTH Fleet

I think this is the longest a CTF has ever taken me
#### Steps

**Challenge 1**
- The first pcap file only has 20 frames
- They are all `URB_BULK` packets, which is a `USB` protocol
- frame number 2 had the visible file name `pcap_chal.pcap` in the hex data
- Seeing this I ran `binwalk` to extract any other files within the pcap
```
└─$ binwalk pcap2_1583863710056.pcapng   

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
471           0x1D7           Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: 2308021, uncompressed size: 2731652, name: pcap_chal.pcap
2309652       0x233E14        End of Zip archive, footer length: 22
```
- Extracting with `binwalk -e` directly didn't work and since the challenge specified maintaining file integrity was really important I decided to try a different method
- Instead I extracted the hex data directly and ran binwalk on that
- For this I used `tshark`
```shell
# -r for infile, -T for text output format, -e specify field, usb.capdata is the leftover capture data
tshark -r pcap2_1583863710056.pcapng -T fields -e usb.capdata > extractedpcap
```
- https://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/u/usb.html -> wireshark docs are helpful for field names
- `extractepcap` is useless to binwalk since it's pure hex data, so I converted it
```shell
# hex to binary
└─$ cat extractedpcap | xxd -r -p >> unhexed

└─$ file unhexed      
unhexed: data

└─$ binwalk unhexed      

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28            0x1C            Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: 2308021, uncompressed size: 2731652, name: pcap_chal.pcap
2308189       0x23385D        End of Zip archive, footer length: 22
```
- Yayyyyyy :>
- Now we can extract with `binwalk -e` with no issues
- CDed into the extracted directory
```shell
└─$ ls
1C.zip  pcap_chal.pcap
```
- `pcap_chal.pcap` is a much larger pcap file filled a variety of requests `ICMP, TCP, TLS, DNS`, etc
- `TCP` and `DNS` requests are usually the easiest to decipher so I started with those
- Following the `TCP` steam first, I found a couple intersting convos

```
- I followed `DNS` aka `UDP` stream next which was mostly just the same google mozzila cloudflare github medium font api oscp (and cyber.meme.tips) things I had seen before
- First I started with the GET request (found in and #2) for the site `fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=e7e47ecfd72c324519c9a72239cd2b399aaafc4b.9686`
- Which was basically steg analysis on this REALLY weird looking picture
- None of the site steg checks found anything useful so I downloaded the image
```

- Ok this might just be nothing
- Moving on to the IRC convo we have the username `binaryphalanx`, the password `RedRoverRedRover$$`, and the unique id `108AAAAAC`
- At this point I was kinda stuck. I have some info but nothing to do with it
- I decided maybeee I should check the `ICMP` packets I had been ignoring for the past hour (there's no easy follow stream option, sue me idc)
- I basically just speed scrolled through `ICMP` packets until I got a bright yellow message transfer param highlighted and continued doing this to decipher the conversation
```
# ROUGH recreation
- hi wyd
= hi nm
- u didn't send the thing
= not over this tf
- ok then over what
= lets use cryptcat instead
- another thing to install?
= no one can see this
- id still rather use encryption
= we need to pick a key to use
- ik just the one 
- Angela Bennett uses it to log into the Bethesda Naval Hospital
= that old thing?
- lemme look it up rq
- found it, use the metasploit port to recieve
= listener is up, send it
- ok, it's sent
= 7181f4d45de00ae35b6cf8201c8d852b
- hash is good
```
- Ok so we have a password `BER5348833` and a tool `cryptcat` 
- The default listening port for most is `4444` so I checked traffic under that port `tcp.port == 4444`
- Used tshark for extraction:
```shell
└─$ tshark -r pcap_chal.pcap -Y 'tcp.dstport == 4444' -Tfields -e data.data > stream
└─$ cat stream | xxd -r -p >> encfile
```
- Transferred and decrypted the file
```shell
└─$ cryptcat -vv -k BER5348833 -lp 7777 > dec

└─$ nc -vv -w 1 localhost 7777 < encfile

└─$ file dec
dec: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=10e9d33fce367a29cfe8d74866c3cb474ec61172, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
```
- Modding perms and running the file itself threw an error
- Running `strings` on the file I found this
```

```
- I also found the string `gethostbyname` which is definitely referring to `DNS`
- Based on the IRC convo from the pcap file earlier I assumed that the DNS resolution was through localhost
- So I modified my `/etc/hosts` file with the `irc.cct` domain
```sh
└─$ sudo sh -c "echo '127.0.0.1 irc.cct' >> /etc/hosts"
```
- The file makes requests through the default IRC port `6667` so I set up a listener with `nc -lvnp 6667` and ran the file
```sh
└─$ ./dec
Found the server at 127.0.0.1
Connected to my server!


└─$ nc -lvnp 6667

- Done! (except for 3 more tasks </3)
